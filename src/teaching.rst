Advanced algorithms
-------------------

I worked on lessons about advanced algorithms to ENSIMAG second-year students
(≈ first-year master’s degree students). I was in charge of:

-  design of the practical work
-  evaluation of the students' work


Introduction to algorithms and programming
------------------------------------------

I had the opportunity to teach introduction to algorithms and
programming to first-year science students.
This experience was great as each year I could follow a single group of
students (≈ 30 students) — as the only teacher of this subject for the
group.

-  design of lecture, exercises, practical work, IT project and exam
-  giving lecture, exercises and practical work
-  evaluation of the students’ work

Here are resources about this class (in French).

Office automation
-----------------

During my PhD, I was first teaching assistant of office automation classes.
I worked with second-year Pharmacy students from Univ. Grenoble.

- giving practical work to the entire class (≈ 100 students)
- design of the practical work
- evaluation of the students' work


Tutoring
--------

During my studies, I worked at University Institute of Technology of Orléans (IUT Orléans).

-  giving support courses in the various IT subjects taught at the IUT
-  following and helping students about their IT projects
