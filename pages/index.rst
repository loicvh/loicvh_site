    <p>I am Millian Poquet, a postdoctoral researcher at Inria, Rennes.</p>

    <p>​My work is mostly about distributed systems, and especially high performance computing platforms. I study resource management techniques to exploit these platforms at best, and I am also interested in studying the applications that run on them. Software development is a passion for me and I believe that software is now key for research and technologies. I believe that knowledge should be shared, and most of my experiments and tools are open source (and reproducible).</p>

    <p>I was born in 1991 in the beautiful maritime city of Martigues. I left the sea to study IT and computer science at Orléans, where I discovered computer science research thanks to Sébastien Limet and Sophie Robert. I then moved to Grenoble for my PhD, supervised by Denis Trystram and Pierre-François Dutot in the amazing Datamove team.</p>
