Advanced algorithms
-------------------

I worked on lessons about advanced algorithms to ENSIMAG second-year students
(≈ first-year master’s degree students). I was in charge of:

-  design of the practical work
-  evaluation of the students' work


Introduction to algorithms and programming
------------------------------------------

I had the opportunity to teach introduction to algorithms and
programming to first-year science students.
This experience was great as each year I could follow a single group of
students (≈ 30 students) — as the only teacher of this subject for the
group.

-  design of lecture, exercises, practical work, IT project and exam
-  giving lecture, exercises and practical work
-  evaluation of the students’ work

Here are resources about this class (in French).

-  `lecture slides <./inf101/slides.pdf>`__
-  exercises (contact me for solutions):

   -  introduction —

   -  loops — `sheet3 <./inf101/feuille3_questions.pdf>`__
   -  functions — `sheet4 <./inf101/feuille4_questions.pdf>`__
   -  arrays — `sheet5 <./inf101/feuille5_questions.pdf>`__
   -  strings — `sheet6 <./inf101/feuille6_questions.pdf>`__
   -  pointers — `sheet7 <./inf101/feuille7_questions.pdf>`__

-  practical work (micro projects — contact me for solutions):

   -  (first sessions were simple bash and C exercises)
   -  array sorting — `tp_sort.pdf <./inf101/tp_sort.pdf>`__
   -  string manipulation, cryptography —

   -  1D and 2D cell automata —

Office automation
-----------------

During my PhD, I was first teaching assistant of office automation classes.
I worked with second-year Pharmacy students from Univ. Grenoble.

- giving practical work to the entire class (≈ 100 students)
- design of the practical work
- evaluation of the students' work


Tutoring
--------

During my studies, I worked at University Institute of Technology of Orléans (IUT Orléans).

-  giving support courses in the various IT subjects taught at the IUT
-  following and helping students about their IT projects
