## 2017
I worked on lessons about advanced algorithms to ENSIMAG second-year students  
(≈ first-year master's degree students).
I was in charge of:

- designing practical work
- evaluating the students' work

## 2015, 2016
I then had the opportunity to teach introduction to algorithms and programming
to first-year science students.

This experience was great as each year I could follow a single group of students
(≈ 30 students)
— as the only teacher of this subject for the group.

I was therefore in charge of:

- designing lecture, exercises, practical work, IT project and exam
- giving lecture, exercises and practical work
- evaluating the students' work

## 2014
During my PhD, I was first teaching assistant of office automation classes.  
I worked with second-year Pharmacy students from Univ. Grenoble and
was in charge of:

- giving practical work to the entire class (≈ students)
- designing the practical work
- marking associated scripts

## 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014

During my studies,
I worked at University Instute of Technology of Orléans (IUT Orléans).  
This work consisted in:

- giving support courses in the various IT subjects taught at the UIT
- following and helping students about their IT projects
