This page presents some of the projects I work on.  
As this page is non-exhaustive and very likely outdated,
feel free to give a look at my
[GitHub](https://github.com/mpoquet) and
[Inria's Gitlab](https://gitlab.inria.fr/mpoquet) pages.

## Batsim
Batsim is a simulator that allows to study resource management policies.  
It emerged from the desire to conduct sounder experiments to assess
platform-level resource management algorithms, and the desire to bridge
the gap between theory and practice at this context.

The first prototypes have been developed by Olivier Richard.  
I then quickly became the main Batsim developer during my PhD
in the Datamove (ex MOAIS) team.

- My [thesis manuscript](/research/phd/manuscript.pdf) (notably chapters 3 and 4)

## SimGrid
SimGrid is a simulation toolkit to study distributed systems.

I used SimGrid during my PhD and conducted minor modifications to it.  
I will work on improving model checking in SimGrid during my postdoc, notably by
working on checkpointing mechanisms.
