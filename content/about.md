## Bio
Hello!
My name is Millian Poquet.  
I was born in 1991 in the beautiful maritime city of
[Martigues](../img/martigues.jpg).

I left the sea to study IT and computer science at [Orléans](../img/orleans.jpg).  
I discovered CS research there thanks to Sébastien Limet and Sophie Robert.

I then went to [Grenoble](../img/grenoble.jpg) to learn how to snowboard and for my PhD.
This work took place in the amazing Datamove team under the supervision of
Denis Trystram and Pierre-François Dutot.

I am currently working in [Rennes](../img/rennes.jpg) with Anne-Cécile Orgerie
and Martin Quinson in the Myriads team.
